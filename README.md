# MDKit (early WiP)

This is a simple, early stage Markdown editor made using SvelteKit.

Currently it uses Remarkable for the Markdown parsing and HTML output, but I'm in the middle of writing my own to use instead.

## Todo

- Finish integrating IndexedDB for storage
- Actually make a good UI
- Add Rich Text Editor features (eg. toolbar)
- Text diffing and "smart highlighting"
- Maybe internally store documents in a Tree ?
